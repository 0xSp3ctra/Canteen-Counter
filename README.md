# Canteen-Counter
Hi all ! I just got here so I'm not sure how it works but anyway. I came here to talk to you and present my end-of-year STI2D option SIN project. Hoping that it will inspire you and that you can help me.

The "Canteen Counter" project is an invention that will allow the refectory of Saint-Nicolas high school to count the comings and goings of students and teachers for their lunch break, define the remaining free places (which can be very useful in the health situation current), create statistics based on the data collected (hours of affluence, waiting times, etc.) and display them on a website available to everyone, all in a few clicks. This project aims first of all for a sustainable dimension because indeed thanks to it, losses in energy, food and unnecessary use of plastics can be avoided, and this is not negligible.

On the project page you have the Arduino code for the HC-SR04 sensor and for sending data to the database, as well as the PHP file for connecting to the MySQL database.
